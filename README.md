# Intel NUC Hackintosh Files
These are the required files needed for Intel NUC 7i7BNH for hackintosh-ing

## Some notes about these files
* The config file is only tested with the 7i7BNH. Other NUC models are not guarnteed to succeed (You probably just need to tweak some parts in the config file)

* This is also only tested for the clover bootloader method so it may or may not work for OpenCore

* If you happen to want ot change the config file, I highly recommend using clover configurator
