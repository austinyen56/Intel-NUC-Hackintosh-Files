# Intel NUC Hackintosh Files
These are the required files needed for Intel NUC 7i7BNH for hackintosh-ing

## Some notes about these files
* The config file is only tested with the 7i7BNH. Other NUC models are not guarnteed to succeed (You probably just need to tweak some parts in the config file)

* This is also only tested for the clover bootloader method so it may or may not work for OpenCore

* If you happen to want to change the config file, I highly recommend using clover configurator

## Update (June 2021) (Ignore if you are ONLY booting MacOS)
* Updated config file for multi- booting. The config file is under ```Config/configNEW.plist```. Be sure to rename it back to ```config.plist``` when using it.

* What's new in the new config file? The new config file takes out the countdown timer and removes unecessary entries which is important for multi-booting

* Tutorial video for multi-booting: TBA
